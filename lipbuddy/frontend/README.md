npm start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see lint errors in the console.

npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It bundles the app in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

npm run eject

Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!

If you’re not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies into your project so you have full control over them.

All of the scripts except eject will still work, but they will reference the copied files. Use this only if you need a fully customizable setup.
