    { id: 1, text: "What is Lip Reading AI?", answer: "Lip Reading AI is a system that interprets speech by analyzing lip movements using computer vision." },
    { id: 2, text: "How does Lip Reading work?", answer: "It uses deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs to map lip movements to words." },
    { id: 3, text: "What datasets are used?", answer: "Popular datasets include GRID, LRW (Lip Reading in the Wild), and LRS3." },
    { id: 4, text: "Is it better than audio speech recognition?", answer: "Lip reading AI can assist audio models, especially in noisy environments, but it's not a complete replacement." },
    { id: 5, text: "Can lip reading be used in security?", answer: "Yes, it can help in surveillance, silent speech interfaces, and accessibility tools." },
    { id: 6, text: "What technologies are used?", answer: "It uses computer vision, deep learning (CNN, RNN, Transformer), and video processing." },
    { id: 7, text: "What is the accuracy of lip reading AI?", answer: "Accuracy depends on dataset and model, but state-of-the-art models can reach over 80% on controlled data." },
    { id: 8, text: "Can it work in real-time?", answer: "Yes, with optimization, lip reading models can process video frames in real-time." },
    { id: 9, text: "Is lip reading AI used in any products?", answer: "It's being explored in accessibility apps, smart assistants, and video conferencing tools." },
    { id: 10, text: "How can I build a lip reading model?", answer: "Start by collecting video data, preprocessing frames, and training a model using deep learning frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow." }
